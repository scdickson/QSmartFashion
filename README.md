SmartFashion is a wearable device that monitors pulse and temperature, two vital signs that are directly related to blood alcohol content. This data is sent to an Android or iOS device via Bluetooth LE. If these measurements are out of a valid range, emergency contacts are sent an SMS with the user's current location. Data can be made publically available and viewable via a web app.
